As a Media Studies student, leanrning to edit photos in photoshop as well as learning to build website using HTML and CSS gave me an opprtunity to make my own portfolio
and showcase my work. The images you will see in thie website are my work and are not there to be stolen. If you want to use theese images, feel free to each out to me.
      <br>
      <br>
People often ask me what kind of images do I like to take or what kind of a photographer I am. I like to take pictures of nature and cities, not necessairly landscpes.
Although I do consider what my subject is, I have learnt that the composition and lighting plays a bigger role on how the sunject is going to appear.
It is equally imporntant to learn the basic of post processing of photos so that you are able to bring the best that photograph has to offer. You can see on the image
below different thing that can be achieved on post processing.

If you click <a href="Edited Pictures.html">here </a> or click on the "Edited PIctures" from the navigation bar, it will take you to the page where you are able to see
some of my images before and after the edits. But here is a little glimpse of those images in a nutshell.
