My name is Anushaj Chhatkuli. I am a student at Borough of Manhattan Community College persuing a degree in Media Studies. I am an amature photographer.
I like taking pictures of various things and not constarin myself to one form of photography such as landscape or portrait. I believe that having techniques and
expericence on various forms of photography can be really useful to create unique pictures through unique prespective. <br>

I like traveling, technology, fashion, food (big fan) and cooking. If you like my work, then feel free to send me recomendation, feedback and support or share my work.
But my images on this website are not for any personal or organizational use. I would rather you contatct me and tell me why you want to use my images, and I would be
happy to have you use my images. <br><br>

Also, remember me if you ever want to capture any momnet of your life but don't want to pay hefty professional prices. I can get the job done without you having to
break the bank. Birthday Parties, Reunions, Family Portrait, be it a wedding or any occasion, I would be more than happy to capture the everlasting moemoireis you are goign to
cheris for the rest of your life.
<br><br>
And anone who want to colaborate with me and create content, wether it be photographs, vidoes or storytelling, feel free to contact me.
